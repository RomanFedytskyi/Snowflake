# Snowflake-App

Snowflake-App is a lightweight and customizable React component library for adding a beautiful snowfall effect to your web applications. It's perfect for creating a festive, wintery atmosphere on your site!

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Effortlessly add a snowfall effect to your React app.
- **Customizable**: Configure the size, speed, and intensity of the snowflakes to match your app's design.
- **Performance-Optimized**: Smooth animations that don't compromise on performance.

## Installation

You can install the Snowflake-App using npm:

```bash
npm install snowflake-app
```

## Usage

To use the Snowfall component in your application, simply import it and add it to your component's render method:

```bash
import React from 'react';
import Snowfall from 'snowflake-app';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Snowfall />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Props

Customize the snowfall effect in your application by passing these props to the `Snowfall` component:

- `sizeRange` (Array of two numbers): Specifies the minimum and maximum size of the snowflakes in pixels. Default is `[10, 30]`.
  
  Example: `<Snowfall sizeRange={[5, 20]} />`

- `speed` (Number): Determines the falling speed of the snowflakes. A higher number results in faster falling snowflakes. Default is `5`.
  
  Example: `<Snowfall speed={4} />`

- `intensity` (Number): Controls the frequency at which snowflakes are generated. A higher number results in more snowflakes being generated, creating a denser snowfall. Default is `100000000`.
  
  Example: `<Snowfall intensity={50000000} />`

These props allow you to fine-tune the snowfall effect to suit the specific needs and design of your application.

## Example with Custom Props

Here's how you can use Snowfall with custom properties:

```bash
<Snowfall sizeRange={[5, 15]} speed={4} intensity={50000000} />
```
